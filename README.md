# How it work
The motion sensor has two states: it sees or does not see a moving object.
That is 1 or 0.
 If the sensor sees movement the piezo element turns on and the LCD screen shows that everything is not in order. Also on the screen there are sensor readings.
 After a few seconds if there is no movement the piezoelectric element turns off.
